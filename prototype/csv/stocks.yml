# Track stock market investments.
# Bundle several transactions into one investment.
# One investment are 1 or more buy actions and all possible subsequent sell actions that include up
# to the number of shares bought in the same investment.
# Types of transactions are `buy`, `sell`, `dividend` and `capital raise`.

# The `wealth` sorts the entries by date and takes care to tax sells. `wealth` deducts taxes from
# profitable share sells with the setting `capital_gains_taxrate` that you can define in the file
# `config.yml`. `wealth` does not tax sells that realize losses.
# Other than the field `date`, wealth can account for intra-day trades by considering the order of
# transactions, i.e. `buy`, and `sell` entries.
