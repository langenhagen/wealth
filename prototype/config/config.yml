# Accounts listed here can provide additional information for the accounts that Wealth derives
# from the transaction csv files. You can add other accounts as well. Wealth will treat
# transactions that involve these accounts as internal transactions.

# The account names should match the account names that you put into the names for the csv files.
# Accounts can have several fields:
#   - iban:  Helps identifying internal transactions.
#   - offset:  You can add an `offset` that defines the initial total balance for any account. This
#              allows to adjust the balances if you you lack old csv files for accounts.
