# Static personal information.
# The use cases in `Wealth` may use the values below in case you don't provide values explicitly.
#
# accounts
#   Accounts listed here can provide additional information for the accounts that Wealth derives
#   from the transaction csv files. You can add other accounts as well. Wealth will treat
#   transactions that involve these accounts as internal transactions.
#
#   The account names should match the account names that you put into the names for the csv files.
#   Accounts can have following fields:
#     - iban:  Helps identifying internal transactions.
#     - offset:  You can add an `offset` that defines the initial total balance for any account.
#                This allows to adjust the balances if you you lack old csv files for accounts.
#

#
# inflation_rate

#

#   Retirement information specifies personal traits that have effect on pension aspects, such as
#   birthday and retirement_age.

#    - birthday: The date of birth in the format DD.MM.YY. Defaults to 200-01-01.
